# Supervised vs Unsupervised learning

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning learn from being given "right answers". There is two types:

### Regression

Predict a number, infinitely many possible outputs

- example predict housing prices from dataset

### Classification

Predict categories, small number of finite outputs

- example: classify if picture is cat or dog

## Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning find something interesting in unlabeled data without being given "right answer".

### Types of Unsupervised learning

Clustering:
The algorithm looks at the data without being given instructions, and it automatically finds patterns and groups/clusters similar data together.

Anomaly detection:
Find unusual data points. An example is fraud detection in financial systems.

Dimensionality reduction:
Take a big data set and compress data using fewer numbers into a much smaller data set.
